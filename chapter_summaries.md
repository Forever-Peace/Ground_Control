# Chapter 1
[Read chapter here](/Ground_Control/ch1/)
* The average run goes for about 4.2 yards. The average NFL running back has an average YPC of about 3.5.
* The three most common outcomes of a run every year for the past six years have been gains of 1, 2, or 3 yards (usually in the order of 2/3/1).
* The 1-3-5 rule: Over a quarter of rushing attempts are over by 1 yard, about half of rushing attempts are over by 3 yards, and about ¾ of rushing attempts are over by 5 yards.
* The 10 at 10 rule: any run that goes at least 10 yards is among the longest 10% of rushing attempts.
* On the field, the ball is spotted “exactly”, but on the stat sheets, field position (and thus yardage) is rounded “up” towards the end zone to the nearest whole yard (except in some particular circumstances, such as when there is less than a yard to go for a first down, in which case the yardage is rounded down in order to leave 1 yard remaining for the first down instead of 0).
* A rushing attempt can be thought of as taking a sample from a distribution of possible outcomes. Examining the distribution across runs for certain players and circumstances can tell us a lot about the nature of the possible outcomes for that players or circumstances. The distribution of all runs is significantly right-skewed (i.e. has a long right tail indicating that there are just a few runs that go for a very long yardage – the “bill gates” of runs).
* A cumulative density plot shows the proportion of runs that make it to particular yardages.
* There are three phases to a run: the yards that are blocked, the yards that are contested (where most runs are stopped), and the open field. The yards that are blocked are mostly “free” for the running back, who generally uses that time to rapidly approach the contested zone. In contrast, open field running has a special type of momentum: each step past the contested zone increases the expected yards remaining on the run. Running gets easier the further the running back goes.

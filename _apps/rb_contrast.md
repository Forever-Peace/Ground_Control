title: Player Comparison Machine
---
![app1](/Ground_Control/img/rb_contrast_guide.bmp)

#### Run command:
{% highlight R %}
library("shiny");
runGitHub("Forever-Peace/GroundControl", subdir = "Chapters/shinyapps/rb_contrast/")
{% endhighlight %}<br/>  
  
The previous app let you compare a selected player to the average. This app lets you compare two players directly to one-another. You can also select one player, change the comparison type to "Years", and compare that player's performance from one year to the next.  
  
To get the app, make sure you have R and Rstudio (described [here](/Ground_Control/apps/install_apps/)), then copy-paste the run command into the "console" window of RStudio.  

Note: "career carries" only includes carries since 2010 (when my data starts)
